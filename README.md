Binary Design System

### Philosophy
The design philosophy is loosely derived from Uber's Base Design System, this focus on simplicity and ease-of-use paired with Power Type's Artific font creates a component library that is both easy to use, and powerful for appearance and functionality.


### Upkeep
I will try my best to work on the project, but updates will be slow as I don't want to run into the issues I did last time. (ie. building the entire library in one go, getting burnt out, and never touching it again)
